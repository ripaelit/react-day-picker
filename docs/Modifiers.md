# Use of modifiers

Modifiers give you the full control over the appearance and the behavior of the date picker. You use modifiers to implement the different logic according to your data.

Modifiers are _named functions_ called when rendering a day cell. They take the day as first argument and return a boolean value. For example, these functions are valid modifiers:

```js
function isSunday(day) {
  return day.getDay() === 0;
}
function isFirstDayOfMonth(day) {
  return day.getDate() === 1;
}
```

You pass modifiers to the Day Picker using the `modifiers` prop:

```jsx
<DayPicker modifiers={{ isSunday, isFirstDayOfMonth }} />
```

#### `selected` and `disabled` modifiers

Under the hood, the `selectedDays` and `disabledDays` props set a `selected` and a `disabled` modifier. This code is the same:

```jsx
<DayPicker disabledDays={ isSunday } selectedDays={ isFirstDayOfMonth } />
<DayPicker modifiers={ { disabled: isSunday, selected: isFirstDayOfMonth }} />
```

### Use modifiers to style the day cells

The CSS class for a day cell will get the modifier (as in [BEM-like syntax](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/)) when the corresponding function returns `true` for the given day.

For example, using the modifiers above, any cell representing a Sunday will have the `DayPicker-Day--isSunday` class name, and the first day of the month will have a `DayPicker-Day--isFirstDayOfMonth` class name.

### Access modifiers from the event handlers

Modifiers are passed as argument to the event handlers:

```jsx
function handleDayClick(e, day, modifiers) {
  if (modifiers.isSunday) {
    console.log('Sunday has been clicked')
  }
}

function handleDayMouseEnter(e, day, { isFirstDayOfMonth }) {
  if (isFirstDayOfMonth) {
    console.log('The first day of month received mouse enter')
  }
}

<DayPicker
  modifiers={{ isSunday, isFirstDayOfMonth }}
  onDayClick={ handleDayClick }
  onDayMouseEnter={ handleDayMouseEnter }
/>
```

### Use DateUtils to create modifiers

react-day-picker includes [DateUtils](DateUtils.md), a small function library useful to simplify the creation of modifiers.
