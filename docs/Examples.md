# Examples with code

The easiest way to see how react-day-picker works is to check the [examples with code](http://gpbl.org/react-day-picker/examples).

## Running the examples locally

If you want to play with the examples, setup the repo and the app:

```
git clone https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker.git
cd react-day-picker && npm install
cd examples && npm install
```

Run the example app from the `examples` directory:

```
npm start
```

then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
You can change the examples [source code](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/master/examples/src/examples) and see the browser live-update them üòç
