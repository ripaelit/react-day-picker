In the [Selecting Days tutorial](/basics/selecting-days). we have set different
modes to change the selection behavior. Under the hood, DayPicker uses some
hooks for handling the interaction with the days, assigning a `selected`
modifier.

To implement a selection behavior other than the built-ins:

- set the selection mode to `mode="uncontrolled"`
- store the selected dates in the parentâ€™s state
- use the `selected` and `onDayClick` props

## Example: single select

The following example reproduces a simplified version of the [useSingleSelect
hook](/api/functions/useselectsingle), used internally when `mode="single"`.

```include
guides/custom-selection-single.tsx
```

## Example: multiple select

This example shows how the [useSelectMultiple
hook](/api/functions/useselectmultiple) works internally when `mode="multiple"`.

```include
guides/custom-selection-multiple.tsx
```
