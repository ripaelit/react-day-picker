In the [Selecting Days tutorial](/basics/selecting-days). we have set different
modes to change the selection behavior. Under the hood, DayPicker uses some
hooks for handling the interaction with the days, assigning a `selected`
modifier.

To implement a selection behavior different from the built-ins, handle the interaction
in the parent component’s. Use the `selected` and `onDayClick` props and add
the selected dates to the component’s state.

## Example: single select

The following example reproduces a simplified version of the [useSingleSelect
hook](/api/functions/usesingleselect), used internally when `mode="single"`.

```include
guides/custom-selection-single.tsx
```

## Example: multiple select

This example shows how the [useMultipleSelect
hook](/api/functions/usemultipleselect) works internally when `mode="multiple"`.

```include
guides/custom-selection-multiple.tsx
```
