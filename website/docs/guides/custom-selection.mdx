In the [Selecting Days tutorial](/basics/selecting-days). we have set different
modes to change the selection behavior. Under the hood, DayPicker handles the
interaction with the days, assigning to them a `selected` modifier.

To implement a selection behavior other than the built-ins, you need to switch
to uncontrolled mode.

1. set the selection mode to `mode="uncontrolled"`
2. store the selected dates in the parentâ€™s state
3. use the `selected` and `onDayClick` props

## Example: single select

```include
guides/custom-selection-single.tsx
```

## Example: multiple select

```include
guides/custom-selection-multiple.tsx
```
