title: Working with Modifiers

A **modifier** is a property that changes the appearance and the behavior of a
day in DayPicker.

## Disabling days

The `disabled` modifier disables the interaction with a day. It is set using the `disabled` prop.

```include
examples/modifiers-disabled.tsx
```

## The `today` modifier

The `today` modifier is added to the current date.

```include
examples/modifiers-today.tsx
```

Change the current date with the `today` prop:

```include
examples/modifiers-today-change.tsx
```

It is possible to toggle off the `today` modifier:

```include
examples/modifiers-today-off.tsx
```

## The `selected` modifier

In the [Selecting Days tutorial](/basics/selecting-days). we have set different
ways to control the selected days. Under the hood, DayPicker handles the
interaction with the days and assigns a `selected` modifier to them.

:::note

For a basic use of a date picker, you usually won’t need to change the selection
behavior. Use [onSelect](/api/interfaces/daypickerprops#onselect) and the
[selection mode](/api/interfaces/daypickerprops#mode) prop to let DayPicker control the
selection.

:::

Customize the selection behavior by letting the parent component’s handling the
interaction with the days. To control the selected days, use the `selected` and
`onDayClick` props and add the dates to the component’s state:

```include
examples/modifiers-selected.tsx
```

By doing this, DayPicker will switch to uncontrolled mode and let you define with more granularity how the selections work.

For example, to select an array of days:

```include
examples/modifiers-selected-multiple.tsx
```

## Custom modifiers

Add new modifiers according to your app’s requirements. For example, a booking
app may use a `booked` modifier to mark days as already booked.

Use the `modifiers` prop to pass an object with custom modifiers. Change the
inline-style of the cell with `modifiersStyles`.

```include
examples/modifiers-custom.tsx
```

## Styling days with modifiers

A day can be styled according to its modifiers – using CSS or inline
styles.

### Styling via class names

- The modifier is added in the class name of the Day element: `.rdp-day_disabled`,
  `.rdp-day_booked`, `.rdp-day_selected`, etc.
- Change the `.rdp-day_` prefix via
  [modifierPrefix](/api/interfaces/daypickerprops#modifierPrefix) prop.
- Or, use [`modifiersClassNames`](/api/interfaces/daypickerprops#modifiersclassnames) to change the whole class name.

```include
examples/modifiers-classnames.tsx
```

### Styling via inline styles

Another practical way is using inline styles. Use
[`modifiersStyles`](/api/interfaces/daypickerprops#modifierstyles) to change the
style of a day matching the specified modifier.

```include
examples/modifiers-style.tsx
```
