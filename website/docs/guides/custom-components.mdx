Using the `components` prop it is possible to replace some of the [internal
components](/api/types/components). The
[useNavigation](/api/functions/usenavigation) and
[useDayPicker](/api/functions/usedaypicker) hooks returns values that can help to
build the components.

### Example: disable rows in the past

The following example implements a custom component to hide the rows of past weeks:

```include
examples/components.tsx
```
