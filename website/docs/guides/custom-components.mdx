Using the `components` prop it is possible to swap most of the [internal
components](/api/interfaces/components) used by DayPicker.

The [useNavigation](/api/functions/usenavigation) and
[useDayPicker](/api/functions/usedaypicker) hooks returns values that can help
to build the components.

### Example: add a time element to the day cell

The following example wrap the `DayContent` element with a `time` HTML tag.

```include
examples/components-day-content.tsx
```

### Example: disable rows in the past

The following example implements a custom component to hide the rows of past weeks:

```include
examples/components.tsx
```
