Use the `components` prop to to swap the [internal
components](/api/interfaces/components) used by DayPicker.

The [useNavigation](/api/functions/usenavigation) and
[useDayPicker](/api/functions/usedaypicker) hooks returns values that can help
to build the components.

### Example: wrap the day

Wrap the `DayContent` element with a `time` HTML tag.

```include
guides/custom-components-day.tsx
```

### Example: disable rows in the past

Implement a custom component to hide the rows of past weeks.

```include
guides/custom-components-disable-row.tsx
```
