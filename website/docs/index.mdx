DayPicker is a date picker component for [React](https://reactjs.org). It allows users to pick dates,
select date ranges, navigate between years, interact with weeks, etc.

### Main features

- unopinionated and extensible user interface
- adopts [date-fns](http://date-fns.org) as date library
- support for [ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA)
- localizable

### Example

```jsx showOutput
function App() {
  const [selected, setSelected] = useState();

  const handleDayClick = (day, { selected }) => {
    if (!selected) setSelected(day);
    else setSelected();
  };

  return <DayPicker onDayClick={handleDayClick} selected={selected} />;
}
```
