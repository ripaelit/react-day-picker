DayPicker is a React component to display a monthly calendar for picking dates.

Thanks to an extensive [set of props](./reference.props), DayPicker helps
developers to implement date pickers – without fighting with JavaScript dates
and complex layouts. 

## Installing DayPicker

1. Add `react-day-picker` to the project’s dependencies:
  ```bash
  yarn add react-day-picker     # when using yarn
  npm install react-day-picker  # when using npm
  ```
2. import DayPicker and its CSS file in your script:
  ```jsx
  import "react-day-picker/dist/style.css";
  import { DayPicker } from "react-day-picker";
  ```

## Quick Start

Familiarize with the component by implementing some basic features.

Without any props, DayPicker renders a monthly calendar:

```jsx preview
function App() {
  return (
    <DayPicker />
  );
}
```

### Changing the month

To change the initial displayed month, use the [initialMonth](./reference/props#initialMonth)
prop:

```jsx preview
function App() {
  return (
    <DayPicker 
      initialMonth={new Date(2020, 8)} 
    />
  );
}
```

### Displaying days as selected

To display days as selected, pass one or more dates to the
[selected](./reference/props#selected) prop:

```jsx preview
function App() {
  return (
    <DayPicker 
      initialMonth={new Date(2020, 8)} 
      selected={[
        new Date(2020, 8, 1), 
        new Date(2020, 8, 19),
        new Date(2020, 8, 21)
      ]}
    />
  );
}
```

### Selecting days

To make days selectable, add a state to the component and use the
[onDayClick](./reference/props#onDayClick) event handler.

```jsx preview
function App() {
  const [selectedDay, setSelectedDay] = useState();
  const handleDayClick = day => setSelectedDay(day);

  return (
    <DayPicker 
      selected={selectedDay} 
      onDayClick={handleDayClick} 
    />
  );
}
```

### Disabling days

To disable days, pass them to the [disabled](./reference/props#disabled) prop:

```jsx preview
function App() {
  const today = new Date();
  const sundays = { daysOfWeek: [0] };
  return (
    <DayPicker 
      disabled={[today, sundays]} 
      onDayClick={day => console.log(day)} 
    />
  );
}
```
