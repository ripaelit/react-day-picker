## Installing DayPicker

1. Add `react-day-picker` to the project’s dependencies:

```bash
yarn add react-day-picker     # when using yarn
npm install react-day-picker  # when using npm
```

2. import DayPicker and its CSS file in your script
:

```jsx
import "react-day-picker/dist/style.css";
import { DayPicker } from "react-day-picker";
```

Familiarize with the component by implementing a basic date picker for selecting a day:

## Selecting a Day

1. listen to the [`onDayClick`](./props#ondayclick) event to get the clicked day;
2. save the clicked day in your component’s state;
3. highlight the selected day using the [`selected`](./props#selected) prop.

```jsx preview
import React, { useState } from "react";
import "react-day-picker/dist/style.css";
import { DayPicker } from "react-day-picker";

function App() {
  const [selectedDay, setSelectedDay] = useState(new Date());
  const handleDayClick = day => setSelectedDay(day);
  return (
    <div>
      <DayPicker selected={selectedDay} onDayClick={handleDayClick} />
      {selectedDay && <span>Selected: {selectedDay.toLocaleDateString()}</span>}
      {!selectedDay && <em>Please select a day.</em>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Selecting Multiple Days

1. initialize the state with an empty array;
2. add the day to the array when a day is clicked;
3. check if the day is already selected to unselect it.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { DayPicker } from "react-day-picker";
import { isSameDay } from "date-fns";

function App() {
  const [selectedDays, setSelectedDays] = useState([]);

  const handleDayClick = day =>
    setSelectedDays(currentDays => {
      const selectedIndex = currentDays.findIndex(d => isSameDay(d, day));
      if (selectedIndex > -1) {
        // Remove the day from the selected ones
        const newDays = [...currentDays];
        newDays.splice(selectedIndex, 1);
        return newDays;
      }
      return [...currentDays, day];
    });

  const nOfDays = selectedDays.length;
  return (
    <div>
      <DayPicker selected={selectedDays} onDayClick={handleDayClick} />
      {nOfDays > 0 && <span>{nOfDays} day(s) selected</span>}
      {nOfDays === 0 && <i>Select some days</i>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Disabling or Hiding Days

Similarly to `selected`, the `hidden` and `disabled` props can be used to hide or disable the day cell. These props too support [few useful types](./matching-days).

For example, the following DayPicker shows a calendar where Tuesdays are disabled and few days are hidden.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { DayPicker } from "react-day-picker";

function App() {
  const [selectedDay, setSelectedDay] = useState([]);
  const isTuesday = day => day.getDay() === 2;
  const hiddenDays = [
    new Date(2019, 8, 26),
    new Date(2019, 8, 27),
    new Date(2019, 8, 28)
  ];
  return (
    <DayPicker
      initialMonth={new Date(2019, 8)}
      selected={selectedDay}
      hidden={hiddenDays}
      disabled={isTuesday}
      onDayClick={day => setSelectedDay(day)}
    />
  );
}
```
