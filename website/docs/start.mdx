DayPicker is a React component to display a monthly calendar for picking dates.
Thanks to an extensive [set of props](./reference/props.mdx), DayPicker helps
developers to implement date pickers – without fighting with JavaScript dates
and complex layouts.

## Installing DayPicker

1. Add `react-day-picker` to the project’s dependencies:
  ```bash
  yarn add react-day-picker@next     # when using yarn
  npm install react-day-picker@next  # when using npm
  ```
2. import DayPicker and its CSS file in your script:
  ```jsx
  import "react-day-picker/dist/style.css";
  import { DayPicker } from "react-day-picker";
  ```

## Example


```jsx preview
import { React, useState } from 'react';

import "react-day-picker/dist/style.css";
import { DayPicker } from "react-day-picker";

function App() {
  const [selectedDay, setSelectedDay] = useState();
  const handleDayClick = day => setSelectedDay(day);

  return (
    <DayPicker
      selected={selectedDay}
      onDayClick={handleDayClick}
    />
  );
}
```
