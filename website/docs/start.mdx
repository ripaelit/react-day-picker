To start using DayPicker in your project add `react-day-picker` to your dependencies:

```bash
yarn add react-day-picker@next     # when using yarn
npm install react-day-picker@next  # when using npm
```

and import `DayPicker` and its CSS in your script:

```jsx showOutput open=no
import { DayPicker } from 'react-day-picker';
function MyComponent() {
  return <DayPicker required onSelect={console.log} />;
}
```

See the [DayPicker Props](/api/interfaces/daypickerprops) for a list of the
available props, or continue with the tutorial.
