To start using DayPicker in your project

1. add `react-day-picker` to your dependencies:
  ```bash
  yarn add react-day-picker@next     # when using yarn
  npm install react-day-picker@next  # when using npm
  ```

2. import `DayPicker` and its CSS in your script:
  ```jsx showOutput open=no
  import { DayPicker } from 'react-day-picker';
  import 'react-day-picker/dist/style.css';

  function MyComponent() {
    return <DayPicker />;
  }
  ```

3. see the [`DayPickerProps`](/api/interfaces/daypickerprops) for a list of the
available props, or continue with the tutorial.
