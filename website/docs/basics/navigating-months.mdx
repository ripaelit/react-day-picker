## Change the initial month

DayPicker displays the month of the current day. To change the
initial month, set the `defaultMonth` prop:

```include
examples/navigation-initialmonth.tsx
```

## Controlling the current month

DayPicker controls the displayed month and store it in its internal state. To
control the current month – for example, for creatinge a "Go to today" button –
set the month yourself in the parent component’s state.

To control the current month, use `month` (as opposed to `defaultMonth`) and
`onMonthChange` to handle the current month.

```include
examples/navigation-uncontrolled.tsx
```

## Limiting the navigable months

As default, DayPicker can navigate indefinitely in the past or in the future.

To limit the navigable months between certain dates, use `fromDate` and `toDate`, `fromMonth`
and `toMonth`, or `fromYear` and `toYear`.

```include
examples/navigation-from-to.tsx
```

## Using a drop-down to change the month

When limiting the navigable months, use `captionLayout` to display a drop-down
(a select HTML element) for navigating between months – instead of the previous
/ next buttons.

```include
examples/navigation-dropdown.tsx
```

## Disabling navigation

To disable the navigation between months, use `disableNavigation`.

```include
examples/navigation-disabled.tsx
```
