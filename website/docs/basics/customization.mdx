## Multiple months

Use the `numberOfMonths` to render more than one calendar.

When rendering multiple months, use `pagedNavigation` to navigate the number of
months per time, and `reverseMonths` to display the latest month first.

```jsx showOutput
import { DayPicker } from 'react-day-picker';

function Example() {
  return <DayPicker numberOfMonths={2} pagedNavigation />;
}
```

## Showing the outside days

Use `showOutsideDays` to display the days falling out the current month.

```jsx showOutput open=no
function Example() {
  return <DayPicker showOutsideDays />;
}
```

## Using fixed weeks

When `showOutsideDays` is turned on, use `fixedWeeks` to display six weeks per
months. This will prevent the calendar to change its height when navigating.

```jsx showOutput open=no
function Example() {
  return <DayPicker showOutsideDays fixedWeeks />;
}
```

## Showing the week numbers

Use `showWeekNumber` to display the week numbers.

```jsx showOutput open=no
function Example() {
  const [weekNumber, setWeekNumber] = useState();
  return (
    <>
      <DayPicker showWeekNumber onWeekNumberClick={(n) => setWeekNumber(n)} />
      <p>You clicked the week n. {weekNumber}</p>
    </>
  );
}
```
