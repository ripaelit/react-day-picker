## Getting the selected day

Use `onSelect` to get the selected day.

```include
examples/selecting-days-single.tsx
```

### Pre-selecting a day

Use `defautSelected` to initialize DayPicker with a pre-selected day.

In combination with `min={1}`, DayPicker will always have a selected date.

For example, to set the default selected date to today:

```include
examples/selecting-days-default.tsx
```

## Selecting multiple days

Use `mode="multiple"` to allow the selection of multiple days:

```include
examples/selecting-days-multiple.tsx
```

### Limiting the amount of selectable days

Use the `min` and `max` props to limit the amount of days that can be selected.

```include
examples/selecting-days-multiple-min-max.tsx
```

## Selecting a range of days

Use `mode="range"` and `onSelectRange` to allow the selection of multiple days.

```include
examples/selecting-days-range.tsx
```

### Limiting the range size

Use the `min` and `max` props to limit the amount of days in the range.

```include
examples/selecting-days-multiple-min-max.tsx
```
