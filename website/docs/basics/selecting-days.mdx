## Getting the selected day

Use `onSelect` to get the selected day.

```include
examples/selecting-days-single.tsx
```

## Pre-selecting a day

Use `defautSelected` to initialize DayPicker with a pre-selected day. In combination with
`required`, DayPicker will always have a selected date.

For example, to set the default selected date to today:

```include
examples/selecting-days-default.tsx
```

## Selecting multiple days

Using `mode="multiple"` to allow the selection of multiple days:

```include
examples/selecting-days-multiple.tsx
```

## Selecting a range of days

Use `mode="range"` and `onSelectRange` to allow the selection of multiple days.

```include
examples/selecting-days-range.tsx
```
