# Type alias: DayPickerProps

Æ¬ **DayPickerProps**: [*DayPickerUncontrolled*](../interfaces/daypickeruncontrolled.md) \| [*DayPickerSingle*](../interfaces/daypickersingle.md) \| [*DayPickerMultiple*](../interfaces/daypickermultiple.md) \| [*DayPickerRange*](../interfaces/daypickerrange.md)

The props for the [DayPicker](../functions/daypicker.md) component.

This type alias depends from the selection mode:

- see [DayPickerBase](../interfaces/daypickerbase.md) when no selection mode is set
- see [DayPickerSingle](../interfaces/daypickersingle.md) when using `mode="single"`
- see [DayPickerMultiple](../interfaces/daypickermultiple.md) when using `mode="multiple"`
- see [DayPickerRange](../interfaces/daypickerrange.md) when using `mode="range"`
