# DayPicker website

Built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/).

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window.
Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

Module reloading is active â€“ meaning you can change the source of DayPicker and
see them applied in website.

```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be
served using any static contents hosting service.
