# DayPicker website

Built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/) and the [typedoc plugin](https://github.com/tgreyuk/typedoc-plugin-markdown).

```
$ yarn develop
```

#### Notes

- All the docs are in the [`docs`](./docs) dir, however some are copied from the package
  using the [`copy-docs`](../scripts/copy-docs.sh) script.
